    Question 2:
        
        There're two 2D - matrix called matrix1 and matrix2.
        Try to combine them and rebuild to another matrix like below.
        
        Notice: For increase calculation speed, try to not use for/while loop to get the goal.
                So you can use all tensorflow function except tf.while_loop()

                   [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,0,0]]
        shape = [5, 10]
